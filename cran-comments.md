## 0.1.0 Resubmission

### Review 1 - 2022-04-05

This is a resubmission. In this version I have addressed the following comments.

#### First comment

> If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) \<doi:...\> authors (year) \<arXiv:...\> authors (year, ISBN:...) or if those are not available: \<https:...\> with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in quotes: "Title")

Edited the description to include a reference (with ISBN) which describes methods related to the package.

#### Second comment

> Please provide a link to the used webservices to the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form \<http:...\> or \<https:...\> with angle brackets for auto-linking and no space after 'http:' and 'https:'.

Added in the necessary URL links to the package description.
